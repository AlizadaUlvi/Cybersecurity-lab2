Let's look all installed modules by using "marketplace search" command.
You can see the columns labeled D and K in the module listing typically refer to:

D: Dependency – This column indicates whether the module has external dependencies that must be installed for the module to function. A star (*) in this column means the module has dependencies.

K: API Key Required – A star (*) in this column signifies that the module requires an API key to operate. This is common for modules that query third-party services.
