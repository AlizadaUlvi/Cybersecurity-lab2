We install all modules by using "marketplace install all" command.

Let's look all installed modules by using "marketplace search" command.

You can see the columns labeled D and K in the module listing typically refer to:

D: Dependency – This column indicates whether the module has external dependencies that must be installed for the module to function. A star (*) in this column means the module has dependencies.

K: API Key Required – A star (*) in this column signifies that the module requires an API key to operate. This is common for modules that query third-party services.

I used "profiller"module to gather and compile detailed information about a person or target entity from various data points collected across different modules. I want to information about a person that username is "alizade.909".

We use "modules load" command.

We start to "run" our module and the websites being viewed that are registered with the username alizade.909.
